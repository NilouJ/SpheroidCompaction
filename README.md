# SpheroidCompaction
hypothesis testing aspheroid compaction and composition

## The distribution of nucleus to nucleus distance of cells in spheroids 

The compactness of the spheroids was calculated by measuring the nucleus-to-nucleus distance between the cells based on the DAPI channel. The cells were detected by applying the local maxima to the DAPI signal. The average number of neighboring cells for each cell and the cell area were also calculated.

## The distance and number of neighbouring cells:
Tessellation methods has been used to calculate the distance and number of neighbouring cells.

## Composition of  the spheroid

The percentage of constituant cells in proliferating, quiescent and necrotic core was calculated.
